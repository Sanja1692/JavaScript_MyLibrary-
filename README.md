# JavaScript_MyLibrary-
JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich while he was working for a company called Netscape. Back then it was called Mocha, and after a long period of updates and improvements on it, it is now called JavaScript. It is however very different from Java, even if part of the name is the same.


It is an interpreted language, which means it needs a translator to translate this programming language to work on it. In our case, the translator will be the browser. Even so, Javascript is by now used not just for building websites as you will learn.

More than just fancy website-interactivity, it supports useful concepts such as OOP, Object Oriented programming (We will learn more about it later :) ).

While in the beginning, most of the usage of Javascript works with the client-side, nowadays it can work on the server-side too using an environment like NodeJS.

All that being said, welcome to the wonderful world of JavaScript (JS).
